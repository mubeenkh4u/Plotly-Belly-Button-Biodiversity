# Plotly-Belly-Button-Biodiversity

## Warning and Use
* In order to run this project, you must host the data contained in `samples.json` under the `static\js` path. This can be done easily by using the terminal function: python -m http.server which starts a local python server defaulted to localhost:8000.
* Alternatively you can use "Go Live" Extension in VSCode to achieve the same results.
